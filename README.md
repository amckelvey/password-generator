# password-generator

My first attempt at a password generator. Didn't quite get it finished.

Functionality should be that a user is queried for 5 criteria in their password:
- password length between 8 and 128 characters long
- does the user want uppercase letters
- does the user want lowercase letters
- does the user want symbols
- does the user want numbers

From this criteria a password should be spit out inside a text box that is copyable by the user. 

I am submitting this as is for now and I have tutoring time to work on and fix it tomorrow.
